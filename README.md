Blueprints to help use a WizMote with Home Assistant

(Borrowed from to add my own variation)

First Setup a esphome WizMote Bridge by adding the config from [jesserockz/wizmote-esphome](https://github.com/jesserockz/wizmote-esphome) into one of your esphome devices that is connected to Home Assistant
Then import any of the relevent blueprints:

- Blueprints for playlist buttons:  [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Favt613%2FhomeAssistant-WizMote%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fwizmote_playlists.yaml)
- Blueprints for action buttons:  [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Favt613%2FhomeAssistant-WizMote%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fwizmote_actions.yaml)
- Blueprints for finding your WizMote MAC:  [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Favt613%2FhomeAssistant-WizMote%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fwizmote_find_mac.yaml)
